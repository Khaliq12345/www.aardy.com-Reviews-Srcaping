82,Carol Fenley,US,3 days ago,"This is the only business I have called and actually had a person answer the phone without going through a menu of numbers to press. It was wonderful. I was nervous and undecided about which insurance I should buy for my trip to the UK  and had several questions. I actually called 3 times. The first time I called I spoke to Stacy and she was so sweet and helpful and answered the questions I had. The next time I called I spoke to Matthew who was friendly and helpful also. After speaking to Matthew I was ready to buy the plan that Stacy and I discussed. Both Mathew and Stacy made this an easy process by being helpful and professional. When I was filling out my info on line I realized I had made a mistake on the date I first bought our plane ticket so when I went to ""edit my plan"" and the price of the plan went down. It kicked me back to the plan selection page. This confused me  because I had filled out all the info they asked for, so I called again and spoke to Louis who was also very helpful and pleasant. I had to start over and fill out info again. I think you must do an excellent job on training and customer service. Stacy, Mathew and Louis were all so friendly and helpful. They all actually acted as if they liked their job. I highly recommend Aardy!"

181,Dorothy Graham,US,"Apr 22, 2022","I asked for a quote online and got an automated one.  My husband called the next day to ask questions of the person, Melanie, who had sent the automated quote of $1038, roughly, and she answered the questions and reiterated the quote amount on the phone.  My husband called back a day later and talked to Jamie, who told him the quote was now a bit less than the one Melanie had given.  My husband checked with me, and we decided to buy.  When my husband called back that same day, he was told that I had made a mistake on the final payment date on the auto quote form, that I had entered 2020 instead of 2022 on the form; therefore the old quotes were invalid.  A supervisor Aaron told him the new quote was in the mid $1600s.. I called Aaron to try to understand how all this had happened and how 3 different conversations had failed to uncover this error and to ask how we could now be sure the current quote would be honored and result in a valid policy.  The failure 3 times of employees to verify customer information and therefore failure to issue a correct quote 3 different times does not inspire confidence in your company and its employees.  Aaron apparently caught the error and was able to explain how it all transpired, but really your other employees need training, or a working brain with which to do a credible job."

She gave me further information and helped me compare two policies to find the one best suited for us.

I really couldn't concentrate on my questions, and I couldn't hear the answers. When I was referred to the licensed sales agents for Travel Guard, I was on hold a long time and no one ever answered. I hung up and re-dialed the sales team and was on hold a long time again until I gave up and hung up.  No idea what to do next.

I had run through the online Aardy site and gotten some quotes but there hadn't been a place to opt out of cancellation insurance so I had put 0 in the trip cost box.  But I wasn't sure if that was the right way to handle the situation so I called Aardy and was connected to Nicole. Nicole was very helpful.  She said that if I put $500 per traveler in the cost box it wouldn't raise the price but would result in more policies to compare.  I ended up going with one of the policies that came up after Nicole's suggestion but not previously."

558,Mel Bollom,US,"Apr 6, 2022","A customer, or Aardy should be able to ask a couple of simple questions of the travel insurance company recommended by Aardy, in a reasonable time frame.  There should be some level of creditability with the insurance company regarding lack of service via communicating by Chat of phone.  When calling the insurance company for something as simple as the ""insured ID"" or ""Certificate #"", a customer or Aardy should not have to wait 15+ minutes to get a Chat response or 45+ minutes to get a phone call response.  That is  very poor service.  If I am in a flight transfer location in a foreign country, and my luggage does not come through, and the next leg of my trip for the cruise leaves in 30 minutes, I cannot wait 45 minutes to get through on the phone to an insurance person on how to deal with the issue.Lack of communication service via both Chat and phone by an insurance company recommended by Aardy is a very poor reflection on Aardy, as well as the insurance company."
559,Henry,US,"Apr 6, 2022",I had an excellent experience with phone support. The agent was knowledgeable and explained every feature of the policy. He did not try to upsell me and recommended coverage based on my specific needs and willingness to take on some risk.

She suggested a phone call but I already had my questions answered by then.  I requested a call back to actually purchase the policy.

He did not try to sell me anything I didn’t need or want. He waited as I processed the information and made my own informed decision. He immediately emailed me a link to buy the policy. He followed up immediately after I purchased it.This was a very good experience all around, perhaps not something one typically finds with an insurance salesman."

In addition to making me feel comfortable in asking some pretty basic questions, he also answered all of them in such a way that I feel very comfortable with our purchase and the money we spent.

In investigating our retirement-based insurance coverage, we began to understand that a medicare based plan would only cover our medical expenses in a foreign hospital up to the level that our insurance company would have been required to cover costs after Medicare picked up the lion's share.  If for some reason we could not travel home soon after an illness or accident hospitalized us in Ireland or Scotland, the costs would have been a real blow.

It was so great to have a caring and competent live voice on the phone.  This made the difference in purchasing the trip cancellation insurance.  Just a note to say, however, that to have travel insurance equal almost 20 percent of the cost of the trip is outrageous and smacks of taking advantage of the COVID health crisis.

876,Mcmugr,US,"Mar 21, 2022","This is the first time using AARDY and I am very pleased with the service received.  I once operated a travel agency and as part of the service provides travel insurance through a private firm. Clients had a choice to take the vendor insurance or the private insurance offered by the agency.  While the cost were relatively the same when you matched coverage, I could offer much more options through the private firm, such as, Cancel For Any Reason.  Repatriation which gets you back home for medical treatment if injured or ill while traveling.  Personally I always use private travel policies because I can match it to my needs.  I decided to use AARP just to see who they recommended.  AARDY was the site recommended and has proven to be excellent.  I use chat and was on the phone twice to clarify features in various policies in which I was interested.  The individuals I talked with were knowledgeable and answered all my questions.  I feel I selected the best product to cover my travel needs.  I plan on using AARDY in the future."

What my complaint is that, instead of just giving me that recording about leaving a message in the 1st place, it would have saved me the @22mins on hold and some aggrivation. Every inquiry and problem encountered in this day and age, is met w/a wait time,but they should have gone to ""leave your info etc"" message in the beginning of the call. TY for listening."

I tried to call, but no answer, so I tried the chat, and my phone rang! (Said probably spam, but I answered and it was an Aardy agent!).  She answered my questions, and even allowed me to ask hypothetical questions such as ""What happens if one of us tests Covid positive the day of the cruise?""  She gave me the details of what we would need to do and how to do it, and what the coverage (reimbursement) would be.  As with my previous interactions with Aardy, customer service was excellent."

1079,Alda,US,"Mar 11, 2022","I was pleased with all the options Aardy came up with but had one question and called to clarify what I needed to do.  I was told that not only did all non-refundable expenses need to be included, but also all pre-paid expenses for any aspect of the trip.  I said that would be only pre-paid expenses that were NON REFUNDABLE and the rep did not think that was the case and had no way to find out without getting in touch with the insurance company.  I guess I could have asked her to do that but decided I would be more comfortable if I called the insurance company.  I did, wait time was an hour but I got all the info I needed and learned that I could choose the expenses I wanted covered and if anything was refundable, it should NOT be included - all made sense to me.  Better safe than sorry.  I then bought the policy through Aardy!!"

I had been trying to find travel insurance which would cover a non-refundable sizable deposit at a New England Inn, but having no luck finding insurers who would insure a domestic trip for US residents.  On AARDY I immediately found a chat option (with a person, not a Bot!). ""Melanie A."" was wonderful:  She took my info, reviewed the options available to me and recommended a specific vendor and policy. She then gave me the link to AARDY's site where I could compare options for myself and see why she had recommended this specific policy. Clearly it was the best option for us, and within five minutes I had purchased the plan AND received an e-mailed copy of a certificate, ID Card, and the policy itself.  Thanks to Melanie's gracious, smart help, a $3,000 cloud hanging over our upcoming vacation has been easily removed.  I strongly recommend using AARDY for travel insurance needs."

1125,Customer,US,"Mar 8, 2022","Finding insurance to cover my travel out of the country was confusing and a bit difficult because one must read the fine print.  I found it very helpful to see the comparison and discuss the relative merits of the policies offered.  I learned that my main concern with coverage is included in the base policy of most companies, so I did not need 'cancel for any reason' coverage.  I knew how to compare with other company quotes and saved myself from making a mistake by asking a key question I might not otherwise have asked.  One policy I looked at did NOT cover Medical Evacuation by plane.  They may have called it Emergency Medical, or something of the sort, but it was not evacuation insurance.  Good to know, and my Aardy agent told me what they recommend for where I'm going--something I did not think to ask and no one volunteered."
1126,Pete C,US,"Mar 8, 2022",I requested an email quote for travel insurance on a trip to Europe coming up in Summer 2022.

The form to fill out on line is short and simple, and the price I paid for the health travel policy was the same as if I had called Seven Corners myself.  I definitely recommend them, especially because I had called another insurance company before finding out about Aardy.com for the same upcoming trip and was offered a much much inferior policy for more money."

I had looked online at various sites as usual, but In the end I decided to try AARP's insurance. It was comparable to other sites but simpler, more concise to decide, and easy to reach an agent on the phone while looking at choices online with him.

I really have to say thank you because even though I spent a good amount on trip insurance that I wish I didn't have to, Aardy's website and the articles comprehensive but super easy to understand and the agent was friendly, sincere, knowledgeable and honest.

I've gone through several company/booking agents, but the prices were exorbitant! Some of them did not respond until a few days later. We have a relative who just went to the Philippines a couple of weeks ago, and that is where my husband learned about Aardy. So he sent me  a message and told me about it.

I have called AARDY twice to discuss travel insurance options and found both agents (human beings answering the phone shortly after my call) very knowledgeable, polite and efficient. Within minutes I had a quote and the information I needed to make a purchase.  I just wish I had called sooner so I could get CFAR coverage.  I went to AARDY’s site after seeing information in AARP magazine.Thank you for helping relieve my mind of one more concern about my trip - unexpected events!"

The quotes were detailed and easy to compare and research. I had a little on-line chat with Amy and I think we are set to go. Easy and done!! I will make a review after our adventure...hopefully we don't have to use this insurance at all!
1450,Customer,US,"Feb 14, 2022","Efficient, professional and pleasant"
1451,Johnnyv,US,"Feb 14, 2022",I thought the process was quite easy to get 12 quotes. Comparison of the coverage by cruise line with recommendations was helpful..
1452,Mark,US,"Feb 14, 2022","Brandon answered all my questions.  He even answered one I hadn't asked about-concerning medical waiver provisions.  One of the policies I was considering did not have the waiver provision which, of course, I wanted.  Knowing that made my decision very easy."

1461,Julie,US,"Feb 13, 2022","This review is just for the purchasing of the policy through Aardy (which I was forwarded to through AARP). I was so overwhelmed and frustrated combing through endless policy options, sites, brokers, etc for our international travel this summer. With Covid, there are so many more questions.When I hit this site, CHAT was available, and I got Darren. He was amazing. Answered all (SO MANY!!) questions...and went back to ensure I fully understood when choosing a plan what I'd be covered for. He also explained that Aardy actually helps you if you need to make a claim, so it removes the frustration of dealing with (or fighting with) the company directly. Hopefully we won't need it, and hopefully if we do it is as good as their front end service. I spent many hours pouring over plans and company. I only wish I had found Aardy sooner."
1462,Norcal,US,"Updated Feb 13, 2022","Dang, it is confusing & time consuming to read thru & fully understand the terms of insurance plans!!  It was very helpful to talk thru my options w/ the agent and to see what coverages I need, based on my unique concerns & risks, and how they interface w/ any existing insurance I had, such as medical, car, credit card.  She did not oversell me, the explanations were clear, & guess what? -- you treat customers w/ respect & efficiency, and we'll come back. I bought from them this time, and I'll come back to Aardy the next time I need travel insurance. Especially in this time of global, required Covid isolation & quarantines."

Even if I had responses from different agents, they all were very knowledgeable and quick in answering my calls/email. The website itself gave me many options for travel insurance so I could select one to fit my needs. I will definitely use your services again for our travels."
1475,Lizzy J,US,"Feb 11, 2022","My travel agent offered several travel insurance policies. Not very knowledgeable in this field, and very concerned about my husband's well being while traveling, I decided to investigate on my own and see what policies Aardy.com. offered. Impressed, I called Aardy and spoke to Terry, who explained everything to me.  For essentially the same cost of those presented by my travel agent, our coverage is much greater and we upgraded hotel coverage should Covid rear its ugly head. Terry was the shining light I needed to feel comfortable and stop worrying. Great peace of mind."
1476,Scott Marber,US,"Feb 11, 2022","I spoke with Terri, Lynne and Katrina, all of whom were fantastic.  Very professional and helpful. Everything was quite easy with one exception, which was not the fault of these wonderful ladies.  I could not find anywhere via the airlines, insurance brokers, country websites where I was traveling or even their embassies what the actual travel insurance entry requirements were for each country (for example quarantine insurance, medical evacuation, medical emergency...) and the minimum dollar coverage per category.  This was a little frustrating because I am still not sure if I have sufficient coverage to enter the country.  I am hopeful this will not be an issue but it would have given some peace of mind to know the legal minimums for entry per country."

1482,Customer,US,"Feb 11, 2022","Great customer service and professionalism, the reason for not giving 5star isn't the service, it's the system, the older you are the more you pay which has nothing to do with health...It's travel insurance if anything goes wrong with the travels not one's health so I see no rational reason why age is a factor. Something needs to be done to review the policies and to eliminate age discrimination factors."
1483,Cruisin' Lisa,US,"Feb 11, 2022","It was easy to use Aardy to find plenty of options for our travel insurance. I filled in answers to the questions as best I could and a list of great options came up.  I narrowed it down to the ones that looked best to me, then called in to make sure I was understanding the terms correctly.  The rep assured me I had correctly calculated the total cost of our trip - cost of cruise PLUS travel to the port, etc, which she called ""door to door"" coverage.  I was very satisfied with that call assuring me about everything and wound up buying what is the perfect policy for us as a result."

I called and spoke to an agent named Terry who was very helpful and answered all my questions (of which I had many) in detail.  She also gave  me information I hadn't thought about asking for.

1688,Jo,US,"Jan 27, 2022","We had some challenges as we got some incorrect information direct from the Insurance Company.  Aaron Garcia, our Aardy representative, went above and beyond to get this resolved.  Both he and I contacted Trawick asking the same question and both got the same incorrect answer about whether Trawick would cover a cruise booked using a non-redeemable travel voucher.  We both called last Saturday; he called again on Monday.  The same person answered both time (a woman named Ray) and said we were not eligible for the insurance.  It took 2 days for us to get an answer from Trawick causing much anguish, frustration and wasted time by both Mr. Garcia and myself.  The clock was ticking for us as we had another trip interruption policy we purchased that we had to cancel within 10 days of purchase if we did not want it.  This should not be that difficult.  Again, Aaron Garcia was incredible to work with, did not give up and followed through, making sure to update me on the progress as it occurred.  We finally got everything set and the 4 of us booked the policy today, thanks to Mr. Garcia.  The person at Trawick would greatly benefit with some additional training."

The agent who responded said that Stacy was on chat could she call me. Shortly after Stacy returned my call, answered all my questions...I have never experienced such fast, quality customer service using chat and phone with multiple people. Thank you!"
1690,Customer,US,"Jan 27, 2022","I chatted with Stacy at the Aardy website and she had an agent - Denise - call me and they were both so prompt, efficient, helpful, and personable.  Trip insurance is one of those things you have to do but I always sort of dread it.  This was absolutely painless and I am confident I have the coverage I need.  Thanks Stacy and Denise!"
1691,Sheila K,US,"Jan 27, 2022","Customer service (Jerome) was professional, thorough and very cordial.

Website is full of information, and more, regarding travel insurance and what you should know and be concern about.  The steps to get a quote was easy with only a few questions to answer.  The quoted price was great (more than half off the premium being quoted by AAA).  Called customer service (spoke with Matthew) just to confirm some items I had questions about.  Matthew was very helpful and courteous.  Great experience overall."
1721,Diane Sala,US,"Jan 25, 2022","A chat ended up a phone call due to complexities of our travel plans.The agent I spoke to did not get all the information (ie all we needed is medical insurance; not trip insurance) and so the quote was very high.  After clearing that up, the rates fell in line with other insurers.  After buying said policies, they were in our emails quickly.  A good resource for other cruises, for sure."

Most of the time I am not worried about the actual ""Cruise rate"" cancelation policy I am concerned with Medical and Evac in the event of the worst case. The cruise line gives a cancel for any reason but the Medical & Evac coverages are pitiful. Aardy has so many company & policies to compare for all the coverages and limits anyone traveling could need. The agents are easy to talk to and ask any questions. I highly recommend it for your travel needs."

A little unsure of what I have purchased based on what I thought I would be required to do...."

1857,Jessica,US,"Jan 15, 2022","I am traveling to the Maldives in a few weeks and the insurance covered with the airline ticket only covered COVID-related incidents. I found Aardy.com in a Google search for travel insurance and the website was so reassuring. The screenshots, the insurance rate comparisons, the ""little-known"" details and facts about traveling abroad were incredibly helpful! I purchased my travel insurance with IMG and I feel much better about knowing I'm covered if I need it. This website is such a resourceful tool. THANK YOU!!!"
1858,Customer Rogers,US,"Jan 15, 2022","The Aardy representative was extremely helpful in finding the right policy for me.  I was looking at a policy that I did not really understand and he let me know how restrictive that policy could be, no changes, and then found the company and coverage I needed for my dog and myself. Bonus: It cost less too.  I called back once and got another agent who was just as helpful and kind.  I feel that my needs are covered, and I have a reassuring feeling of having chosen well with responsive reps."

1978,Customer,US,"Jan 4, 2022",Initial company (USI) I located and requested 'cancel for any reason' declined our card (no reason given).  I reentered the data knowing the card was good; interestingly they no longer offered 'cancel for any reason'.  I can only assume they refused us the first time because of ages (both senior citizens).

The quote was concise, straightforward. Great responsiveness on the phone. I started calling the phone number to ask a couple of questions but got interrupted by something at home and I ended the call before anyone answered. Within about 15-20 minutes--before I had a chance to call them--they had noticed the missed call and they called me! Nice, helpful real people!  No entering 1 for this, 2 for that...Policy itself was reasonably priced, and understandable, didn't require a lawyer to interpret. Highly recommend Aardy!"

When I called Aardy, I was amazed by how knowledgeable and acessable their staff was. I also didn't realize this firm represents multiple carriers, so they were able to provide an ideal solution to meet my situation.  I spoke with multiple agents (due to circumstances at my end) and they all shared an outstanding culture and standards of service. This was one of the best - and most unexpected - customer service experiences I've ever had. Can't recommend them too strongly!"

He was fine with that, with no pressure. Due to Christmas didn't call back till Dec 28, 2021 and so glad I did. After talking a little while he did remember me as he had lived in my area before.  Matthew again went out of his way to answer my questions. Yes it was because of his confidence in the plan that I purchase one.

One quick call to an agent answered all of my questions as well as allowed me to purchase the insurance immediately with the agent on the phone.  The agent was very knowledgeable and understood and answered my questions very quickly.

They were very knowledgeable and patient answering a multitude of questions I presented for answers.  The price I paid for the policy was very fair and and covered all the provisions I needed for my international travel.  The one provision I needed the most was a significant amount of emergency medial coverage since Medicare will not pay claims while outside of the country.  IMG was the best source for this coverage.  Looking forward to my forthcoming trip and hope I do not have to use any of the provisions of the policy.

2075,Retiredboomers,US,"Dec 21, 2021","Cruise Insurance was confusing because ""destination"" was over a dozen places.  Phone call talked me through the issues,  Further research found cheaper rates except we were too old or gone too long. Discussion with our healthcare insurance revealed we already had some coverage, so we took a lower coverage option.  In summary, enough help to understand the issues, enough options to tailor to our needs, and a better price than we found anywhere else."

Stacy listened to me question (I was primarily interested in medical and quarantine) and recommended  the lower end policy from one of the insurers.  I chose the higher level from the same insurer because it would be the primary insurer if I needed medical care, not the secondary.  My computer froze and I had to phone in to complete my purchase.

The only change that I would suggest, is when you go back to the quote and then buy the plan, it doesn't give you an opportunity to review/change the start date of the trip or the total amount.  When I initially did the query, I had not yet booked the trip and I guessed at the amount.  I just picked an arbitrary date.  I did not realize this until the purchase was complete."

I can't review based on the actual policy that we ended up getting just yet. However, for people on a budget and as a trusted site representing older individuals it was disappointing that you use the ""dynamic pricing"" gimmick to force people to pay higher pricing than initially quoted for something this important. Just like airlines do. I find that to be a really poor business practice. I don't know why websites are able to get away with it. I know insurance companies can be sketchy .. let's hope if I need to file a claim that they come through. Will review later if needed."

We heard about Aardy.Com so decided to go that route this time. We put in the necessary info and quickly received various options to cover our needs. After reading through the information we did have some questions. Called Aardy.com and lucky for us, Katrina took our call. She answered every question we had and even took the time to read the fine print in the policy to make sure she was giving us the correct information. I feel very confident in our final decision. We purchased a policy that should meet our needs 100%. Once again, Katrina was professional, polite, patient, and very thorough. We are very relieved to have this piece of the trip completed.

3451,Bill Jacobs,US,"Aug 15, 2021","I am going on a cruise in January, 2022 and had come across an ad for Aardy.com about paying less for travel insurance than what a cruise company charges. I pulled up their website, inputted the necessary passenger and travel information and viewed a list of insurance companies they represent. I received quotes from enough companies from which to choose.  I proceeded to call Aardy.com for clarification on a few items and spoke to a agent named Jerome. Jerome was professional and knowledgeable about the insurance companies his company utilized. I also felt he was very personable and easy to talk to. We worked through what I needed for six travelers and together we chose what I felt was a comprehensive policy at a reasonable price.  He took all the information, priced it out and even informed me it was lower than the quote on line by a few dollars because of the age of one of the passengers.  The transaction was quick and information given to him appeared on the emailed confirmation correctly.  Jerome needed a few middle names I didn't have, I got them after our phone call and called back.  To my amazement, Jerome answered the phone.  He took down the additional information and emailed the chosen insurance company.  Jerome mention when I said I was surprised I was talking to him again, that the phone system is set up to route calls to the agent who last took the call unless the agent is on another call.  That's an excellent idea because it is good to speak to the same agent if possible. I was very pleased with my overall experience with Aardy.com and Jerome."

I had some very complicated questions about people, what gets covered, etc and we worked through all the points. She had one answer confirmation I needed from my airline and then suggested I call back. She apologized for changing her mind several times as she worked through the information and I explained I appreciated that she took the time to really understand the situation and wasn't getting frustrated or rushing to help me with incorrect answers. When Ic called back, I spoke to Jerome. (Actually, he had already called this morning returning the call I had left for Terri last night.) I was disappointed Terri wasn't available since she knew the situation so well, but Jerome was equally thorough, pleasant, patient, also correcting himself and apologizing and VERY willing to try the quotes several ways. It was a true pleasure working with him and I have nothing but positive things to say about the experience (as long as if we end up needing the insurance, it goes as planned- which I have little doubt it won't)! GOOD JOB JEROME AND TERRI! I hope management knows what gems you are:)"

Both the agents I interacted with on chat were helpful and provided me with quotes from multiple insurance carriers. After I asked a couple of questions via chat, the agent suggested that it might be more convenient if they called me on the phone to discuss my options. Steven, the agent who called me, proved to be very knowledgeable and helpful. He answered my questions and explained the differences between the quotes I had received. After I told him that I was most concerned about hurricane insurance because of the area I was planning to visit, he looked through the quotes, picked out the best option for hurricane coverage and explained how it compared vs. some of the others. The icing on the cake was that he lived close to the area I was planning to visit and provided me with local knowledge about the impact of weather on the area. All in all, this was about as pleasant a process of buying insurance as I have ever had. I will absolutely use AARDY the next time I need trip insurance."

3588,Ohio Viking Traveler,US,"Aug 7, 2021","We chose an AIG Travel Policy instead of the offered Viking policy.  I found the process confusing in spite of clear details for the various policies.  The AIG policy offered several things not in the Viking policy.  It's an expensive crap shoot not matter you choose.The pay off is really needing the policy coverage.  I hope that it is not needed - 'wasted' money like all insurance.  But if you need it, nice to have in your pocket.  How AIG might perform if a claim is made - who knows.So I bought a policy from AIG - mostly a random selection from a list of qualified providers.  I have no idea if I made a wise choice!Four stars, because the process was easy but who knows how well AIG might perform to earn five stars...."

I actually learned that the original plan I was going to purchase really didn't offer me the extended coverage if wanted in the event of COVID quarantine. Although the First Class insurance that I actually purchased had many more features than I needed, it was also only a couple of hundred dollars more to get the extended coverage I wanted. The agent, Brandon, was patient with me and carefully answered all of my questions and made sure I understood and was satisfied with my choice.

3741,Spunky,US,"Jul 30, 2021",Different agents I speak with at AARDY give me different direction and opposing information. I ended up being given incorrect information which cost me a lot of money. Finally ended up talking to Trawick and a very nice person there corrected all of the problems. I initially put a deposit on a trip and then when I paid remaining balances I tried to increase the value of the policy. One AARDY agent sold me two individual policies one for my husband and one for myself when I wanted a joint policy. I agreed to keep it because they said it was the same. But when I tried to increase the insurance amount of the policies there was a problem. The agent that day told me it is cheaper if I was insuring a couple then buying 2 separate policies so I was looking at a higher cost.  I was then advised to buy another joint policy which was less expensive and stack the policies. At this point I had 3 policies for the same trip. I eventually called Trawick rather than work through AARDY and thankfully they straightened this mess out. You can't stack policies. Other problems. The agents at AARDY are not all well trained leading to confusion. You might want to call travel insurance companies directly.

I then called the phone number listed at the top & got very good information which helped me go ahead and purchase a policy. With all the fine print, it is a challenge to select a policy which will work. The Aardy selection of the best policies for me certainly helped pare it down. I will use it again."

I liked that you could compare several different policies, it made deciding which plan fit my needs very easy.  Prices were better than going directly through the insurance company.  After choosing my policy and making the payment, I immediately received my confirmation email and policy from the insurance company.  I have not traveled yet, so I am not sure how claims are handled and hopefully all will go as planned and I won't need to find out!  Thanks for making insurance buying easy!!"

3754,Faith Heim,US,"Jul 30, 2021",I started looking in 1/21 for cruise ins. I looked at Aardy and saw that I have used them several times before and it was easy. So after getting quote I cked several other quotes. I spent 6 months and Aardy was still there with quote that remained the lowest for the best cover age. You can pay less but you will not be covered like with Aardy. Check for yourself. The cruise lines dont offer hardly any coverage and cost more. Im over covered with Aardy for less premium.So after 7 months I bought it today. My cruise is in Nov. I could have waited longer but I am comfortable knowing it done and Im protected.

I looked on your website to book my plan there but the same insurance was quoted at almost $300 more than Aaron had quoted. I called and spoke with a very sweet young lady who checked into this and she said at first her quote turned up the plan with almost $300 more than Aaron's quote but then said she found the one for $642.98 which is what Aaron had quoted. They were both very helpful and knowledgeable and I appreciated them both.

4259,Randy Becker,US,"Jun 26, 2021","Planning a trip for 2022 and wanted to make sure I had travel insurance. I had done some independent research on costs and coverages and begun to create my own spreadsheet. Then I remembered Aardy from a previous trip and went to their site.  With a few simple pieces of information, I was offered a quote for several insurers to compare -- compare not only among those offered by Aardy but also against my own research.  The recommendation from Aardy matched my own research and confirmed my own thoughts about needed coverage.  In the end, Aardy came in slightly less than I had found in my own research .... PLUS it was easier to deal with them than most insurance company websites.  Look, compare, consider, decide ... click - done.  And a word to those who say that spending about 12% of trip costs on insurance is too much:  without it you could lose all your deposits, or even worse, you could end up facing major bills that could wipe out much of your retirement savings. If you have the money for a major trip, you should have the money to insure it.  If the past year and more has taught us anything, it is that you never know for certain what will happen."

It is confusing to select insurance since coverage and reimbursement amounts vary widely and optional coverage gets quite confusing. I'm still not sure I picked the ""best"" insurance for our needs, but got weary of reading the fine print! Not Aardy.com's fault, but buying travel insurance really is a mess!"

4384,Elizabeth ,US,"Updated Jun 15, 2021","Having only purchased travel insurance offered by a cruise line or tour operator I was unsure where to find coverage for an upcoming trip to Scotland. As a member of AAA I started there but was still not comfortable making this purchase. Being a senior citizen I turned to AARP for guidance and was given a wealth of information and directed to Aardy.com. After reading AARP's Trip Insurance 101, I felt much more comfortable making my decision but still had a few questions about adding on to my coverage later. I called Aardy's number and was told I could wait on hold or if I preferred, press any key and they would call me back. I decided to hang up and use the ""chat"" online feature. The chat went well and my questions were answered. Now I felt comfortable making my decision. Shortly after my chat ended, I received a phone call from Aardvark, which I believe handles Aardy's coverage for international travel. I told him my questions had already been answered by the online chat and he told me that he knew I had called and just wanted to be sure I knew Aardy was there to help me. I was very impressed by that kind of customer service. And he ended my call by saying ""Cheerio"" which was delightful."

When we communicated in the chat room, he said that certain wordings could not be included regarding AIG Insurance coverage for Covid-19 were it diagnosed in a passenger 72 hours prior to departure. I would feel much more comfortable if I knew that the full cost of my trip is covered IF I were diagnosed with Covid just 72 hours prior to departure.  The airlines and the travel company ( Viking ) require this test.  If I am found positive, they will not let me board the plane or depart on one of their ships. Hopefully, AIG would cover the full cost of my trip. Both my wife Lori and myself are fully vaccinated against Covid-19."

I have no knowledge of the outcome of making a claim, but I certainly felt I was able to purchase travel insurance with Alyce with great confidence.  She  explained every viable choice for me in great detail, and made the process pleasant and seamless.  (I must also mention my initial contact with Denise and Reese was also very professional.)"

4574,Satisfied Customer,US,"May 30, 2021","Overall I was pleased with my experience on Aardy.  However, I would have preferred to be able to see quotes from more than just two providers.  I understand that not all carriers offer coverage to all age groups and/or all locations, but I would have had more confidence in Aardy's quotes if they had informed me that these were the only two carriers who would cover us.That said, the coverage we purchased was from a well-regarded company (based on my preparatory online research) and seemed fairly priced."

4581,Customer,US,"May 29, 2021",Excellent Service - Contacted the agency multiple times on phone and chat to answer questions. Always prompt and pleasant answers and direction.
4582,Customer,US,"May 29, 2021","The process was extremely easy.  The chat feature is a true benefit.  Im not that familiar with insurance terms and the rep was able to easily explain terms I did not understand.  I chose a policy from a certain insurance company and then went to that insurance company's website.  I found the same coverage under a slightly different name but for a higher price.  The chat rep explained that this was because AARDY is an aggregator so they offer a better price.  Makes perfect sense.  So, I purchased from AARDY.  The policy arrived with the Insurance company logo on it.  So, now I hope that if there is any problem on my trip, this does not prove to be a problem having a 3rd party in the selling formula."

4597,Robert Matteucci,US,"May 28, 2021","I purchased travel insurance through IMG and even though my cruise line cancelled our trip, IMG refused to pay anything.  They state  a customer has only 10 days to cancel the policy from the purchase date, so when our cruise line cancelled our trip, I assumed that the trip insurance would be refunded…WRONG.  I would stay away from this company."

THANK YOU, BRANDON!!!  After looking over the plan, I agreed with him but had a few more questions.  Matthew answered the phone and quickly answered every question I asked.  After that, I hit the ""Buy Now"" button and am a happy man.  All business' customer services should be this good.  I will be back as a future customer.  They know what they're doing and were very helpful.  Give these guys a raise!!!"

4604,Cheryl Smithers,US,"May 26, 2021","Although my husband and I have travelled extensively over the years, we have never purchased travel insurance in the past.  I contacted Aardy by phone and discussed the most advantageous policy that covered what I needed at a reasonable price.  I reviewed the quote, coverage and amount via email and several days later called to clarify questions via phone, and ultimately purchase the policy for an upcoming trip overseas this fall.  The service was excellent, the reps pleasant and efficient and I received my policy confirmation before I had ended the call.  Our decision to purchase at this time was determined by the Covid pandemic, economic and political uncertainty of some areas as well as our increasing age in case of illness or accidents.  Hopefully, we will not need to put in any claims."

Your rep said that he could not speak for the insurance company. I have tried calling the insurance company at two different phone numbers and they do not answer the phone, you sit on hold.So do not tell me you courteously answered my question. Why should I pay for something never delivered if the situation was as I described, multiple reasons a replacement cruise could not be taken?Still useless!!!!"

I worked primarily with one agent to sort through 13 options and boiled it down to 3 in a matter of 20 minutes. While he was busy sharing wisdom with another traveler another agent stepped in for him and was just as sharp. Our journey involves coverage of 3 organized back to back tours and independent travel between and at the conclusion of this journey from Italy to Iceland. They were knowledgeable, accurate, patient and polite. In the end they saved us $500 on the same policy offered by the insurance company's agents,  and countless hours of trying to compare policies on our own. These guys deserve 10 stars not just 5!"

Since it was under the AARP query I looked at, I felt very comfortable with it.I did have a few questions and I did a chat with Steven, the client manager. He answered my questions (with good explanations and examples), and helped me to understand the policy.  I felt very comfortable purchasing the policy after our discussion.  Also, the policy I got was great.  It was less than most of the ones I was looking at, and great coverage.  Also...the chat was quickly answered and I was not ""put on hold while a representative was reviewing my file"" . It was quick and very efficient. Highly recommend this company."

Normally I use one of your competitors, however, this time I could not find my needs on their site. So, this is your chance to possibly earn me as a long term customer.

Two weeks before we (30 people) were supposed to leave, our travel agent informed us that we did not have the right insurance under new COVID regulations.
