# www.aardy.com-Reviews-Srcaping
Businesses that want to stay in the market for a long time must value their customers’ feedback. 
It gives them a fair idea of what their customers are not enjoying and what changes they should make to make them happy.

## Project Idea
For this project, I scrape data the customer reviews of Aardy.com in Trust pilot. You can use this scraped data to do sentiment analysis and perform the necessary statistical analysis to draw insightful conclusions.

## Web Scraping Tool: 
For this project, I use Beautiful Soup (Python’s open-source library) as it will allow you to crawl the website and extract the review from the Amazon website using HTML tags.
